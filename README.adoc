= UnifiedPush Operator

== Metrics

The application-monitoring stack provisioned by the
https://github.com/integr8ly/application-monitoring-operator[application-monitoring-operator]
can be used to gather metrics from the operator here.  Once you have
provisioned that (or the ServiceMonitor CRD at a minimum), you can run
the following commands to configure it:

```
kubectl label namespace unifiedpush monitoring-key=middleware
kubectl create -n unifiedpush -f deploy/service_monitor.yaml
```

== Development

=== Prerequisites

- Access to an OpenShift cluster with admin privileges to be able to create Roles.
  https://github.com/minishift/minishift[Minishift] is suggested.

- Go, Make, dep, operator-sdk, kubectl (kubectl can just be a symlink to oc)

=== Running the operator

1. Prepare the operator project:

```
make cluster/prepare
```

2. Run the operator (locally, not in OpenShift):

```
make code/run
```

3. Create a UPS instance (in another terminal):

```
kubectl apply -f deploy/crds/aerogear_v1alpha1_unifiedpushserver_cr.yaml
```

4. Watch the status of your UPS instance provisioning (optional):

```
watch -n1 "kubectl get po && echo '' && kubectl get ups -o yaml"
```

5. When finished, clean up:

```
make cluster/clean
```
